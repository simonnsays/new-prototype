Bugs/Problems:
- [/] Placing a PC case when a case is already on the canvas does not replace the pc (the pc does not return to inventory)
        [PC case now replaces the one placed in canvas and returns the old case to inventory]
- [/] Placing components when the component shelf is already full just returns error (no more indexes on shelf, see main.updateInv()) 
        [Component shelf now returns the last component to inventory and adds the new component]
- [/] clicking on a new component when a component of the same type is already attached to the pc case removes the already attached component
- [/] search/category problem: once category is pressed and turned off, all items are gone
- [/] s/c problem: once you type in search and delete all text, items are gone
- [/] on startup, upon choosing a category and unclicking it, items are gone. Items comes back after typing a search (problem with intialization of shop.searchResults)
- [|] placing components to canvas doesnt update inventory properly
        |_ [] double items are being deleted on first click, prolly a shop implementation error
- [|] rehaul of shop intialization
        |_ [] clear of filters after exiting shop area
        |_ [] application of filters (search and category)
- [|] rehaul of shop div update
- [|] rehaul of inventory div update
