To-Dos:

- [] Money Simulation (both in shops and component prices) 
- [] The "Assistant" 
        |_ [] add error and warning messages
- [] Choose between 'Tutorial' and 'Free build' mode Page 
- [] Final Page (show components as a list)
- [|] Sort Items by Category
        |_ [/] upon press of a category, keep shadow on it

Bugs/Problems:

- [/] Placing a PC case when a case is already on the canvas does not replace the pc (the pc does not return to inventory)
        [PC case now replaces the one placed in canvas and returns the old case to inventory]
- [/] Placing components when the component shelf is already full just returns error (no more indexes on shelf, see main.updateInv()) 
        [Component shelf now returns the last component to inventory and adds the new component]
- [/] clicking on a new component when a component of the same type is already attached to the pc case removes the already attached component
